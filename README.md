# Solution-to-Atmospheric-Chemistry-and-Physics-From-Air-Pollution-to-Climate-Change
Solution to first chapter of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics From Air Pollution to Climate Change

This Code aims to solve the following exercises:

1.1A Calculate the concentration (iri molecules cm-'1) and the mixing ratio (in ppm) of water vapor at ground level at T â€” 298 K at RH values of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 99%.

1.2A Determine the concentration (in jig m~3) for N20 at a mixing ratio of 311 ppb at p= latm and T = 298 K.

1.3A A typical global concentration of hydroxyl (OH) radicals is about 106 molecules cm 3. What is the mixing ratio corresponding to this concentration at sea level and 298 K?

1.4A Measurements of dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3) during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment-1 (ACE-1) conducted November-December 1995 off Tasmania were in the range of 250-500 ngm I Convert these values to mixing ratios in ppt at 298 K at sea level.
